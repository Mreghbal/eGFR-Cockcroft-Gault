# eGFR-Cockcroft-Gault
Here's a complete Python code to calculate the Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) using the Cockcroft-Gault equation
In this code, the calculate_egfr function takes four parameters: age (in years), weight (in kilograms), serum_creatinine (in mg/dL), and is_male (a boolean indicating whether the patient is male). It returns the calculated eGFR value.

To use the function, you can provide the required input values and call the function. The example above demonstrates how to calculate and print the eGFR for a 40-year-old male who weighs 70 kg and has a serum creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL.

Note that the Cockcroft-Gault equation is an estimation and may not be suitable for all populations or clinical situations. It is important to consult with a healthcare professional for accurate assessments of kidney function.
